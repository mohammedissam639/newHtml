    <h2 id="ab">About the course</h2>
    <p> Develops algedraic concepts and skills need to graph and solve linear equalities.Evaluating algebraic expressions and formulas according to the rules of operations is also developed. </p>
    
    <h2 id="wm">what is math ?</h2>
    <p>Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,[1] algebra,[2] geometry,[1] and analysis,[3][4] respectively. There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.</p>
   <h2 id="me">Math Equations</h2>
    <p>The most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials. The sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation</p><br>

    <h2 id="g">Geometry </h2>
     <p>A fundamental innovation was the ancient Greeks' introduction of the concept of proofs, which require that every assertion must be proved. For example, it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (theorems) and a few basic statements. The basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (postulates), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (axioms). This principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by Euclid around 300 BC in his book Elements.</p>
      <h2 id="ms">Mathematical Symbols</h2>
         <p>These letters alone are not sufficient for the needs of mathematicians, and many other symbols are used. Some take their origin in punctuation marks and diacritics traditionally used in typography; others by deforming letter forms, as in the cases of 
            ∈\in  and 
            ∀\forall . Others, such as + and =, were specially designed for mathematics.</p>
